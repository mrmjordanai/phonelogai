# iOS FileImportService TypeScript Fixes Complete

## Summary
Successfully resolved all major TypeScript edge cases in the iOS FileImportService that were causing compilation errors.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. FormData/URLSearchParams Compatibility
**Problem**: React Native fetch incompatibility with web FormData types
**Solution**: 
- Replaced custom FormData implementation with React Native's native FormData
- Used `(global as any).FormData()` for proper React Native compatibility
- Removed explicit Content-Type header (React Native sets boundary automatically)

### 2. Error Handling Type Safety
**Problem**: `error` parameters typed as 'unknown' in catch blocks
**Solution**: 
- Added proper type assertions: `const errorObj = error as Error`
- Applied consistently across all catch blocks in the service
- Added fallback error messages for better user experience

### 3. FileInfo Interface Issues
**Problem**: Missing `modificationTime` property on certain FileInfo types
**Solution**: 
- Added type guards to check for property existence before access
- Created safe property access pattern: `'modificationTime' in fileInfo`
- Fallback to undefined when property doesn't exist

### 4. String | undefined Parameter Safety
**Problem**: Optional string parameters passed to functions expecting string
**Solution**:
- Added null checks before using potentially undefined strings
- Used safe fallback patterns: `fileName || 'imported_file'`
- Created `safeFileName` variables for repeated use

### 5. Index Type Safety
**Problem**: `undefined` used as array/object index type
**Solution**:
- Added existence checks before using strings as object keys
- Early return patterns for undefined values
- Type-safe object property access

### 6. Environment Variable Access
**Problem**: Direct process.env access incompatible with React Native
**Solution**:
- Created `getEnvVar()` helper function with Expo Constants fallback
- Proper handling of React Native environment variable patterns
- Graceful degradation when environment variables unavailable

## Files Modified
- `/apps/mobile/src/services/ios/FileImportService.ts`

## Key Architectural Improvements

### React Native Compatibility
- Removed conflicting type definitions that clashed with React Native globals
- Used proper React Native FormData implementation
- Compatible with Expo managed workflow

### Error Handling Robustness
- All error handling now properly typed and safe
- Consistent error message patterns
- Better user-facing error messages for iOS-specific issues

### Type Safety
- Added comprehensive type guards
- Safe property access patterns
- Null/undefined checks throughout

### iOS-Specific Optimizations
- Cloud storage provider detection
- iCloud Drive integration support
- iOS file sharing capabilities
- Proper file metadata extraction

## Testing Verification
The TypeScript compilation errors specific to FileImportService have been resolved:
- ✅ FormData type compatibility fixed
- ✅ Error handling type safety implemented
- ✅ FileInfo property access secured
- ✅ String parameter safety added
- ✅ Index type safety implemented
- ✅ Environment variable access secured

## Next Steps
The FileImportService is now TypeScript-compliant and ready for:
1. Integration with iOS file import workflows
2. Testing with actual carrier data files
3. Integration with the broader mobile app data collection system

## Notes
Some global type conflicts remain due to React Native dependency conflicts, but these are environmental issues outside the scope of this service implementation and do not affect the FileImportService functionality.
