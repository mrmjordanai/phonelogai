## Usage

### Basic Implementation
```tsx
import { EventsScreen } from './screens/EventsScreen';

// In your navigator
<Stack.Screen 
  name="Events" 
  component={EventsScreen}
  options={{
    title: 'Events',
    headerShown: false, // EventsScreen manages its own header
  }}
/>
```

### Enhanced Implementation with Full Features
```tsx
import { EnhancedEventsScreen } from './screens/EventsScreen/EnhancedEventsScreen';

// For production with all optimizations
<Stack.Screen 
  name="Events" 
  component={EnhancedEventsScreen}
  options={{
    title: 'Events',
    headerShown: false,
  }}
/>
```

### Custom Configuration
```tsx
// Custom hooks usage
const eventsHook = useEvents({
  pageSize: 25, // Smaller pages for slower devices
  cacheEnabled: true,
});

const filtersHook = useEventFilters({
  persistFilters: true,
  debounceMs: 500, // Longer debounce for slower devices
});
```
