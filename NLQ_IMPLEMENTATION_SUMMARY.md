## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. **Basic Setup**
```bash
# Ensure environment variables are set
# In apps/web/.env.local:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key # Optional

# Start the web app
cd apps/web
npm run dev
```

### 2. **Integration in Your App**
```tsx
import { ChatInterface } from '@/components/nlq/ChatInterface'
import { useState } from 'react'

function YourComponent() {
  const [chatOpen, setChatOpen] = useState(false)
  const userId = 'user-id' // Get from auth
  
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setChatOpen(true)}>
        Open Natural Language Query
      </button>
      
      <ChatInterface
        userId={userId}
        isOpen={chatOpen}
        onClose={() => setChatOpen(false)}
      />
    </>
  )
}
```

### 3. **Using the Hook Directly**
```tsx
import { useNLQ } from '@/hooks/useNLQ'

function QueryComponent() {
  const {
    messages,
    isLoading,
    submitQuery,
    exportResults,
    suggestions
  } = useNLQ()
  
  // Submit a query
  const handleQuery = async () => {
    await submitQuery("How many calls did I make today?")
  }
  
  // Export results
  const handleExport = (messageId: string) => {
    exportResults(messageId, 'csv')
  }
  
  return (
    // Your UI here
  )
}
```

## üîß Configuration Options

### OpenAI Integration
When `OPENAI_API_KEY` is configured:
- Queries are processed using GPT-3.5 for better SQL generation
- More complex queries can be understood
- Natural language understanding is more flexible

Without OpenAI:
- Falls back to pattern matching
- Still supports common query patterns
- Works perfectly for standard queries

### Demo Mode
When no user is authenticated:
- Returns mock data for testing
- Allows UI/UX testing without database
- Perfect for development and demos

## üìä Supported Query Examples

### Simple Queries
- "How many calls did I make today?"
- "Show me my recent messages"
- "What is my average call duration?"
- "List my last 10 calls"

### Moderate Queries
- "Who did I talk to most this week?"
- "Show me all calls longer than 10 minutes"
- "What are my busiest hours?"
- "How many unique contacts this month?"

### Complex Queries
- "Compare my call activity this week vs last week"
- "Show me contacts I haven't talked to in 30 days"
- "Find patterns in weekend vs weekday communication"
- "What's my ratio of incoming to outgoing calls?"

## üé® UI Features

### Message Display
- User messages (blue, right-aligned)
- Assistant messages (gray, left-aligned)
- Error messages (red border)
- Streaming indicators
- Timestamps

### Results Visualization
- Expandable table view
- First 10 rows displayed inline
- Full export for complete datasets
- Column headers with data types

### Interactive Elements
- Copy SQL to clipboard
- Export results (CSV/JSON)
- Expand/collapse results
- Clear history
- Retry failed queries

## üîê Security Features

- SQL injection prevention
- User ID filtering enforced
- Read-only queries only
- Rate limiting ready
- Authentication required (except demo mode)

## üö¶ Next Steps

### Immediate Enhancements
1. Add voice input support
2. Implement query templates/saved queries
3. Add visualization charts for results
4. Implement query sharing functionality

### Future Features
1. Multi-language support
2. Advanced analytics with AI insights
3. Query scheduling/automation
4. Collaborative query sessions
5. Query result caching

## üìù Testing the Implementation

### 1. **Test Without Authentication (Demo Mode)**
```bash
# Visit http://localhost:3000
# Open the NLQ interface
# Try queries - will return mock data
```

### 2. **Test With Authentication**
```bash
# Log in to the app
# Open NLQ interface
# Queries will run against real database
```

### 3. **Test OpenAI Integration**
```bash
# Add OPENAI_API_KEY to .env.local
# Restart the app
# Try complex queries like:
# "Show me a breakdown of my communication patterns"
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Unauthorized" error**
   - Ensure user is logged in
   - Check Supabase auth configuration

2. **"Failed to execute query"**
   - Check database connection
   - Verify RLS policies allow access
   - Check SQL syntax in generated query

3. **No suggestions appearing**
   - Verify suggestions endpoint is accessible
   - Check browser console for errors

4. **Streaming not working**
   - Ensure browser supports EventSource
   - Check network tab for streaming response

## üìä Performance Considerations

- Queries are limited to 1000 rows by default
- Results over 100 rows are paginated in UI
- History is limited to 100 messages
- Suggestions are cached for 5 minutes
- SQL queries timeout after 30 seconds

## üéâ Summary

The NLQ implementation is now complete and ready for use! It provides:
- ‚úÖ Intuitive chat interface
- ‚úÖ Natural language to SQL conversion
- ‚úÖ Real-time streaming responses
- ‚úÖ Export capabilities
- ‚úÖ Query suggestions
- ‚úÖ Demo mode for testing
- ‚úÖ Optional AI enhancement

The system is designed to be extensible and can easily accommodate additional query patterns and features as needed.
