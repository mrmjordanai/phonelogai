# Security and Privacy System Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Implementing comprehensive security and privacy controls for PhoneLog AI's Call/SMS Intelligence Platform, building on existing infrastructure including RLS policies, audit logging, and anonymization systems.

## Current Infrastructure Analysis

### Existing Foundation (STRENGTHS)
- **Database Schema**: Comprehensive tables for privacy_rules, audit_log, org_roles with proper foreign keys
- **RLS Policies**: Well-designed Row-Level Security with helper functions for role checks and org boundaries
- **Anonymization System**: Basic anonymization types and strategies in packages/shared/src/anonymization/
- **RBAC Foundation**: 5-tier role system (owner > admin > analyst > member > viewer) with org context
- **Contact Privacy**: Basic privacy_rules table with visibility types (private/team/public)

### Gaps Identified (TO IMPLEMENT)
- **Field-Level Encryption**: No encryption for sensitive data (phone numbers, content)
- **Enhanced Audit Logging**: Missing context capture and detailed operation tracking
- **Privacy Controls UI**: No user interfaces for privacy rule management
- **Compliance Features**: Missing GDPR/CCPA DSR endpoints and data retention
- **Incident Management**: Basic structure exists but needs security context integration
- **Data Retention**: No automated cleanup or retention policies

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Enhancement

## Phase 2: Privacy Controls Implementation

### 2.1 Privacy Rule Engine
**Target**: Advanced privacy controls with inheritance and bulk operations

**Implementation**:
- Create `PrivacyRuleEngine` for complex rule evaluation

### 2.2 RBAC System Enhancement
**Target**: Granular permissions and role-based data access

**Implementation**:
- Create permission matrix for each role level
- Add granular permissions for specific operations (export, anonymize, etc.)
- Implement context-aware permission checks
- Add temporary elevated permissions for specific operations

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `packages/shared/src/rbac/PermissionMatrix.ts` (NEW)
- `packages/database/src/rbac/RoleManager.ts` (NEW)
- `packages/database/migrations/007_rbac_enhancements.sql` (NEW)

### 2.3 Data Retention and Cleanup
**Target**: Automated data lifecycle management

**Implementation**:
- Create data retention policies per org/user
- Implement automated cleanup jobs
- Add data archival before deletion
- Create retention policy UI controls

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `packages/database/src/retention/RetentionPolicyEngine.ts` (NEW)
- `packages/database/migrations/008_data_retention.sql` (NEW)

## Phase 3: User Interface Implementation

### 3.1 Web Privacy Controls UI
**Target**: Comprehensive privacy management interface

- Privacy dashboard showing current rules and data visibility
- Contact-level privacy controls with bulk operations
- Organization-wide privacy policy management
- Data export and anonymization controls

- **Privacy**: 100% contact data respects privacy rules, bulk operations support 10k+ contacts
- **Compliance**: Automated DSR response <24h, complete audit logs for 7 years

## Risk Mitigation
- **Performance Impact**: Use indexed encryption keys, optimize RLS policies
- **Data Migration**: Implement encryption in backwards-compatible way
- **User Experience**: Progressive privacy controls, clear privacy status indicators
- **Compliance Burden**: Automated compliance workflows, clear documentation

## Next Steps

2. Begin Phase 1 implementation with field-level encryption
3. Iterative development with security testing at each phase
4. User acceptance testing for privacy controls
5. Compliance audit and certification preparation
