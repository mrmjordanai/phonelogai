# Sync Health Database Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement comprehensive database layer for the Sync Health Monitoring System to provide real-time monitoring capabilities for mobile app data synchronization across multiple sources (calls, SMS, manual uploads).

## Current State Analysis

### 1. Examine Existing Infrastructure
- Review current `sync_health` table schema
- Analyze existing `analyze_sync_health` function
- Understand integration with events table and user data
- Identify gaps in current implementation

### 2. Database Functions to Implement

#### Core Functions
1. **`get_sync_health_status(user_id)`**
   - Returns current sync health status for a user
   - Includes overall health score, last sync times per source
   - Performance target: <500ms response time

2. **`update_sync_health_metrics(user_id, source, metrics)`**
   - Updates health metrics for specific data source
   - Handles metrics like sync duration, record count, error count
   - Atomic updates with conflict resolution

3. **`detect_sync_issues(user_id, threshold_hours)`**
   - Identifies sync problems based on configurable thresholds
   - Returns categorized issues (stale data, gaps, failures)
   - Optimized for real-time alerting

4. **`get_sync_health_history(user_id, days)`**
   - Historical health data for trend analysis
   - Aggregated metrics over time periods
   - Supports dashboard visualizations

5. **`calculate_data_drift(user_id, source)`**
   - Calculates drift percentage between expected and actual data
   - Compares against baseline patterns
   - Mobile-specific drift detection

6. **`get_queue_health_metrics(user_id)`**
   - Queue depth and age analysis for offline sync
   - Pending operations count and oldest item timestamp
   - Critical for mobile offline-first architecture

### 3. Database Schema Enhancements
- Add indexes for performance optimization
- Ensure proper RLS policies for multi-tenant access
- Add new columns if needed for enhanced metrics
- Foreign key relationships with events and users tables

### 4. Migration Strategy
- Create sequential migration file
- Update database types generation
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Performance impact assessment

### 5. TypeScript Integration
- Wrapper functions in `packages/database`
- Type definitions for sync health data structures
- Client utilities for React components
- Error handling and validation

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Examination
- [ ] Examine existing `sync_health` table schema
- [ ] Review current `analyze_sync_health` function
- [ ] Understand current RLS policies
- [ ] Identify performance bottlenecks

### Phase 2: Database Functions Implementation
- [ ] Create core sync health functions
- [ ] Implement queue health metrics
- [ ] Add data drift calculation
- [ ] Optimize for mobile usage patterns

### Phase 3: Migration and Schema Updates
- [ ] Create migration file with new functions
- [ ] Add necessary indexes for performance
- [ ] Update RLS policies
- [ ] Regenerate database types

### Phase 4: TypeScript Utilities
- [ ] Create wrapper functions in database package
- [ ] Add type definitions
- [ ] Implement client utilities
- [ ] Add error handling patterns

## Success Criteria

### Performance Requirements
- Function response times <500ms for real-time queries
- Historical queries <2s for dashboard usage
- Optimized for mobile app usage patterns
- Scalable to handle 1M+ events per user

### Functionality Requirements
- Real-time sync health monitoring
- Multi-source data tracking (calls, SMS, uploads)
- Queue health for offline sync
- Data drift detection and alerting
- Historical trend analysis

### Integration Requirements
- Seamless integration with existing sync_health table
- Compatible with mobile offline queue system
- Proper RLS policy enforcement
- Type-safe TypeScript interfaces

## Technical Considerations

### Mobile-Specific Optimizations
- Efficient queries for battery-conscious mobile apps
- Offline queue health monitoring
- Platform-specific sync patterns (Android vs iOS)
- Conflict resolution for sync operations

### Security & Privacy
- RLS policies for multi-tenant data isolation
- Audit logging for health metric access
- Privacy-compliant metrics collection
- User consent for detailed monitoring

### Performance Optimization
- Strategic indexing for time-series queries
- Efficient aggregation functions
- Cached metrics for real-time dashboards
- Connection pooling considerations

## Risk Mitigation
- Backward compatibility with existing systems
- Gradual rollout with feature flags
- Performance monitoring during deployment
- Rollback strategy for migration issues
