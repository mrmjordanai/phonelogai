# RBAC Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enforcement across all layers of the Call/SMS Intelligence Platform with 5-tier role hierarchy and organization-scoped security.

## Role Hierarchy (Power Level 1-5)
- **Owner (5)**: Full access, billing, org settings, user management
- **Admin (4)**: User management, privacy rules, integrations, system config  
- **Analyst (3)**: Data exploration, export within policy, advanced analytics
- **Member (2)**: Full personal data, team dashboards per policy, basic features
- **Viewer (1)**: Read-only dashboard access, limited data visibility

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core RBAC Foundation
1. **Shared Types & Constants** (`packages/shared/src/rbac/`)
   - Define role hierarchy, permission types, resource types
   - Create permission matrix mappings
   - Establish RBAC constants and enums

2. **Database RBAC Layer** (`packages/database/src/rbac/`)
   - Core RBAC manager for role checking
   - Permission calculation engine
   - Database middleware for query filtering
   - Integration with existing RLS policies

### Phase 2: Backend Integration  
3. **API Middleware** (`apps/web/src/middleware/`)
   - Authentication verification
   - Role-based route protection
   - Organization-scoped access control
   - Permission guards for endpoints

### Phase 3: Frontend Integration
4. **Web RBAC Components** (`apps/web/src/rbac/`)
   - React context provider for RBAC state
   - Permission wrapper components
   - Role-based conditional rendering
   - Permission hooks for components

### Phase 4: Mobile Integration
5. **Mobile RBAC System** (`apps/mobile/src/rbac/`)
   - Mobile RBAC provider
   - Permission-based screen routing
   - Local RBAC state management
   - Mobile-specific permission hooks

## Key Features

### Security Features
- **Defense in Depth**: Multi-layer access control (DB RLS + API + Frontend)
- **Privilege Escalation Prevention**: Role hierarchy enforcement
- **Organization Isolation**: Strict org-scoped access control
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive access decision tracking
- **JIT Access**: Time-based temporary permissions
- **API Key Mapping**: Service account role assignments

### Performance Features
- **Permission Caching**: Redis-backed permission cache
- **Lazy Loading**: On-demand permission evaluation
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized database access patterns
- **Minimal Overhead**: <5ms permission check latency

### User Experience Features
- **Clear Feedback**: Descriptive permission denied messages
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Hide unavailable features
- **Role Templates**: Pre-configured permission sets
- **Delegation Support**: Temporary role assignments

## Resource-Action Permission Matrix

### Resources
- **Events**: Call/SMS data access
- **Contacts**: Contact information and privacy
- **Organizations**: Org settings and management
- **Users**: User management and roles
- **Dashboards**: Analytics and reporting
- **Integrations**: External service connections
- **Billing**: Payment and subscription data
- **Audit**: System logs and compliance

### Actions
- **READ**: View data and information
- **WRITE**: Create and update data
- **DELETE**: Remove data and records
- **MANAGE**: Administrative operations
- **EXPORT**: Data export capabilities
- **BULK**: Bulk operations on data

## Integration Points

### Database Integration
- Extend existing RLS policies with role checks
- Add RBAC functions to database schema
- Integrate with audit logging system
- Support cross-org access scenarios

### API Integration  
- Middleware stack for all endpoints
- Resource-specific permission guards
- Organization context extraction
- Rate limiting by role level

### Frontend Integration
- Seamless integration with existing auth
- Component-level permission wrapping
- Menu/navigation role filtering
- Feature flag integration

### Mobile Integration
- Platform-specific permission handling
- Offline permission caching
- Sync conflict resolution with roles
- Native permission integration

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Permission calculation logic
- Role hierarchy comparisons
- Policy evaluation engine
- Middleware functionality

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end permission flows
- Cross-layer security validation
- Organization isolation testing
- Performance benchmarking

### Security Tests
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Authorization bypass testing
- Edge case validation
- Compliance verification

## Performance Targets
- Permission check latency: <5ms p95
- Cache hit ratio: >90% for permission checks
- Database query impact: <10% overhead
- Memory usage: <50MB for full permission matrix

## Compliance Features
- GDPR access control alignment
- SOC 2 audit trail support
- Role-based data retention
- Compliance export formatting

## Migration Strategy
- Backward compatibility with existing auth
- Gradual rollout by feature area
- Permission migration scripts
- Fallback to existing security during transition

## Success Metrics
- Zero privilege escalation incidents
- <1% permission-related support tickets
- 100% compliance audit coverage
- Performance targets maintained

## Risk Mitigation
- **Over-permissive defaults**: Start with restrictive permissions
- **Performance degradation**: Implement aggressive caching
- **Complex role conflicts**: Clear hierarchy resolution rules
- **Migration issues**: Comprehensive testing and rollback plans

This plan ensures secure, performant, and maintainable RBAC implementation across all platform layers while maintaining existing functionality and security guarantees.
