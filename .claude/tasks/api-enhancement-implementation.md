# Complete API Enhancement Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan implements a comprehensive 4-phase API enhancement for the PhoneLog AI platform, building upon the existing API foundation to provide production-ready file upload, template management, job management, and real-time communication capabilities.

## Architecture Foundation
- **Existing Base**: API routes in `apps/web/src/app/api/parser/` with auth/RBAC middleware
- **ML Integration**: Python workers via Redis/Celery in `workers/` directory
- **Database**: Supabase with RLS policies and comprehensive schema
- **Authentication**: Existing auth patterns with 5-tier RBAC system
- **Performance Targets**: 100k rows in <5min, 1M rows in <30min, NLQ p95 <5s

## Phase 1: Enhanced Upload API
### Objectives
- Chunked/streaming uploads for large files (100MB+ support)
- Cloud storage integration (S3-compatible)
- Advanced content validation and resumable uploads
- Real-time progress tracking

### Implementation Components
1. **Enhanced Upload Endpoint** (`/api/parser/upload`)
   - Chunked upload support with multipart handling
   - S3/cloud storage integration for file persistence
   - Content validation (virus scanning, format detection)
   - Resume capability with chunk tracking

2. **Upload Session Management** (`/api/parser/upload/session`)
   - Create/resume upload sessions
   - Track chunk progress and metadata
   - Handle upload failures and retries

3. **Storage Service Integration**
   - S3-compatible storage adapter
   - Temporary storage for chunks
   - File encryption and security

### Files to Create/Modify
- `/api/parser/upload/route.ts` (enhance existing)
- `/api/parser/upload/session/route.ts` (new)
- `/api/parser/upload/chunk/route.ts` (new)
- Storage service utilities

## Phase 2: Template Management APIs
### Objectives
- CRUD operations for parsing templates
- ML-powered template suggestions
- Manual mapping workflow for custom formats
- Template analytics and versioning

### Implementation Components
1. **Template CRUD** (`/api/templates/`)
   - Create, read, update, delete templates
   - Version control and rollback capability
   - Template validation and testing

2. **ML Template Suggestions** (`/api/templates/suggest`)
   - Auto-detect file format and suggest templates
   - ML-powered field mapping recommendations
   - Confidence scoring for suggestions

3. **Manual Mapping Workflow** (`/api/templates/mapping`)
   - Interactive field mapping interface
   - Preview and validation of mappings
   - Save custom templates from mappings

### Files to Create
- `/api/templates/route.ts`
- `/api/templates/[templateId]/route.ts`
- `/api/templates/suggest/route.ts`
- `/api/templates/mapping/route.ts`
- `/api/templates/analytics/route.ts`

## Phase 3: Advanced Job Management
### Objectives
- Bulk operations (retry, cancel, delete)
- Enhanced filtering and search
- Resource tracking and performance metrics
- Job analytics and reporting

### Implementation Components
1. **Enhanced Job Operations** (extend existing `/api/parser/jobs`)
   - Bulk retry/cancel/delete operations
   - Advanced filtering by multiple criteria
   - Job search with full-text capabilities

2. **Resource Tracking** (`/api/parser/resources`)
   - Memory and CPU usage monitoring
   - Queue depth and processing capacity
   - Performance metrics and trends

3. **Job Analytics** (`/api/parser/analytics`)
   - Processing time trends
   - Success/failure rates
   - Resource utilization reports

### Files to Modify/Create
- `/api/parser/jobs/route.ts` (enhance existing)
- `/api/parser/jobs/bulk/route.ts` (new)
- `/api/parser/resources/route.ts` (new)
- `/api/parser/analytics/route.ts` (new)

## Phase 4: Real-time Communication & Monitoring
### Objectives
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Webhook notifications for external systems
- System health monitoring and alerts
- Usage analytics and dashboards

### Implementation Components
1. **WebSocket Implementation** (`/api/ws/`)
   - Real-time job progress updates
   - System status notifications
   - User-specific event streams

2. **Webhook System** (`/api/webhooks/`)
   - Configure webhook endpoints
   - Event filtering and routing
   - Retry logic and failure handling

3. **System Monitoring** (`/api/system/`)
   - Health checks and status endpoints
   - Performance metrics collection
   - Alert configuration and management

### Files to Create
- `/api/ws/[...slug]/route.ts` (WebSocket handler)
- `/api/webhooks/route.ts`
- `/api/webhooks/[webhookId]/route.ts`
- `/api/system/health/route.ts`
- `/api/system/metrics/route.ts`
- `/api/system/alerts/route.ts`

## Implementation Strategy

### Step 1: Database Schema Extensions
Create new tables for:
- `upload_sessions` (chunked upload tracking)
- `parsing_templates` (template storage and versioning)
- `template_mappings` (field mapping configurations)
- `job_analytics` (performance metrics)
- `webhooks` (webhook configurations)
- `system_metrics` (monitoring data)

### Step 2: Shared Services Development
Build reusable services:
- `StorageService` (S3-compatible storage)
- `WebSocketManager` (real-time communication)
- `TemplateEngine` (template processing)
- `MetricsCollector` (performance tracking)

### Step 3: API Route Implementation
Implement routes in phases:
1. Enhanced Upload API with chunking and storage
2. Template Management with ML integration
3. Advanced Job Management with analytics
4. Real-time Communication and monitoring

### Step 4: Integration and Testing
- Integration with existing ML workers
- End-to-end testing across web and mobile
- Performance testing with target metrics
- Security audit and validation

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Requirements
- Support concurrent uploads up to 100MB files
- Real-time updates with <100ms latency
- Database queries optimized for large datasets
- Horizontal scaling for worker processes

### Security Requirements
- File validation and virus scanning
- Secure file storage with encryption
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Audit logging for all operations

### Scalability Design
- Microservice-compatible architecture
- Database connection pooling
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Queue-based processing for heavy operations

## Success Metrics
- File upload success rate >99%
- Processing time targets met (100k <5min, 1M <30min)
- Real-time update latency <100ms
- API response time p95 <500ms
- System uptime >99.9%

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve this implementation plan
2. Begin Phase 1 implementation with enhanced upload API
3. Create database schema migrations
4. Implement shared services and utilities
5. Progressive rollout across all 4 phases

This implementation will provide a robust, scalable, and feature-rich API foundation that seamlessly integrates with the existing PhoneLog AI platform while enabling advanced file processing, template management, and real-time monitoring capabilities.
