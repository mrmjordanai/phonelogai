# Data Validation Pipeline Implementation Plan

## Overview
Build a comprehensive data validation pipeline that integrates with the existing PhoneLog AI architecture to provide robust field mapping, normalization, and duplicate detection capabilities.

## Architecture Integration
- Integrate with existing database schema from `packages/database/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
- Use ML classification from `layout_classifier.py` for intelligent field mapping
- Leverage template management from `template_manager.py` for format handling
- Work with existing anonymization system from `packages/database/src/anonymization/`
- Integrate with Celery task framework for distributed processing

## Core Components

- **Data quality scoring** using multiple metrics
- **Semantic field matching** using existing template system

**Key Features**:
- ML-powered field detection using layout_classifier models
- Rule-based fallback for unmapped fields
- Confidence scoring per field mapping (target >95% accuracy)
- Integration with CarrierTemplate system
- Support for custom field mappings and user overrides

### 2. Data Normalization Engine
**Location**: `workers/src/phonelogai_workers/validation/normalizer.py`

- **Duration calculation** supporting various units (seconds, minutes, hours, HMS format)
- **Content sanitization** with PII detection and masking
- **Geographic data normalization** (area codes, regions, carrier identification)

**Key Features**:
- Comprehensive phone number validation and formatting
- Multi-format date/time parsing with auto-detection
- Duration conversion and validation (0-86400 seconds)
- Content sanitization respecting privacy rules
- Geographic data enrichment and validation

### 3. Duplicate Detection System
**Location**: `workers/src/phonelogai_workers/validation/deduplicator.py`
- **Composite key deduplication** as per database schema
- **Conflict resolution strategies** (latest wins, manual review, intelligent merge)
- **Data merge algorithms** for combining duplicate records
- **Gap detection** for missing data periods
- **Performance optimization** for large datasets

**Key Features**:
- >99% duplicate detection accuracy using composite keys (user_id, line_id, ts, number, direction, duration)
- Intelligent conflict resolution with configurable strategies
- Gap detection with configurable thresholds
- Batch processing for performance (100k rows <5min, 1M rows <30min)
