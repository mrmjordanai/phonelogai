# Sync Health Monitoring System Implementation Plan

## Overview
Create a comprehensive sync health monitoring system for the Call/SMS Intelligence Platform mobile app that tracks data synchronization health, detects issues, and provides users with visibility into sync status.

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Core Architecture
- **Real-time monitoring** of sync operations from offline queue
- **Database integration** with existing `sync_health` table and `analyze_sync_health` function
- **Multi-source tracking** (call log, SMS, manual uploads)
- **Performance optimization** with minimal battery and memory impact
- **Type-safe implementation** throughout with proper TypeScript types

### 2. Component Structure

#### 2.1 SyncHealthMonitor.ts - Main Monitoring System
**Purpose**: Central orchestrator for sync health tracking and reporting

**Key Features**:
- Real-time sync health tracking with EventEmitter pattern
- Integration with database `sync_health` table and `analyze_sync_health` function
- Health status calculation based on configurable thresholds
- Automatic issue detection with severity classification
- Performance metrics collection and aggregation
- Background monitoring with proper lifecycle management

**Core Methods**:
- `startMonitoring()` - Initialize monitoring system
- `updateSyncStatus()` - Update health status for specific source
- `calculateHealthScore()` - Aggregate health across all sources
- `detectIssues()` - Identify sync problems and categorize severity
- `getHealthReport()` - Generate comprehensive health report

#### 2.2 SyncHealthDisplay.tsx - User Dashboard
**Purpose**: User-facing interface for sync health visualization

**Key Features**:
- Real-time sync status visualization (healthy/warning/error states)
- Last sync timestamps with relative time formatting
- Queue depth indicators with trend analysis
- Data drift percentage display with historical context
- Sync health history and trend visualizations
- Responsive design optimized for mobile devices

**Visual Components**:
- Health status badge with color coding
- Progress indicators for sync operations
- Historical trend charts (last 24h/7d/30d)
- Data source breakdown with individual status
- Alert indicators for critical issues

#### 2.3 SyncMetrics.ts - Metrics Collection Engine
**Purpose**: Collect, analyze, and store sync performance metrics

**Key Features**:
- Sync performance tracking (latency, throughput, success rate)
- Data drift calculation using temporal analysis
- Queue depth monitoring with age-based analysis
- Success/failure rate analysis with trend detection
- Network connectivity impact analysis
- Battery usage optimization through efficient data collection

**Metrics Categories**:
- **Performance**: sync duration, queue processing rate, data throughput
- **Reliability**: success/failure rates, retry attempts, error categorization
- **Timeliness**: data drift percentage, sync lag, queue age distribution
- **System Impact**: battery usage, memory consumption, network utilization

#### 2.4 HealthChecker.ts - Health Assessment Engine
**Purpose**: Automated health assessment and issue detection

**Key Features**:
- Configurable health check thresholds and rules
- Data gap detection integration with existing database functions

**Health Assessment Logic**:
- **Healthy**: All sources syncing within thresholds, queue depth < 100, drift < 5%
- **Warning**: Moderate delays, queue depth 100-500, drift 5-15%, minor issues
- **Error**: Sync failures, queue depth > 500, drift > 15%, critical issues

#### 2.5 SyncNotifications.tsx - Notification System
**Purpose**: User notification system for sync issues and status updates

**Key Features**:
- Push notifications for critical sync issues
- In-app notifications for status changes
- Data drift warnings with actionable guidance

- Recovery completion notifications
- Notification priority management and throttling

**Notification Categories**:
- **Critical**: Sync failures, data loss risk, system errors
