- Connection stability tracking
- Background/foreground state awareness

**Implementation Details**:
- Use @react-native-netinfo/netinfo for connectivity
- Implement connection quality scoring
- Wi-Fi preferred sync logic
- Cellular fallback after 24 hours or 1MB queue size
- Event-driven notifications for network changes

### 4. QueueManager.ts - Main Queue Management
**Purpose**: Core queue management with priority processing and performance monitoring.

**Key Features**:
- Priority-based queue processing (high > normal > low)
- Age and size-based sync triggers
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff (max 5 retries)
- Queue size management and cleanup
- Performance metrics and monitoring
- Memory-efficient processing

**Implementation Details**:
- Process items in priority order
- Batch processing for efficiency (50-100 items per batch)
- Dead letter queue for failed items
- Metrics tracking: queue depth, processing time, success rate
- Background task support with app state management

### 5. SyncEngine.ts - Synchronization Logic
**Purpose**: Handle the actual sync operations with conflict resolution and progress tracking.

**Key Features**:
- Network-aware batch processing
- Conflict resolution using composite keys
- Progress tracking with callbacks
- Integration with existing Supabase client
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery

**Implementation Details**:
- Implement sync strategies: immediate, batched, scheduled
- Conflict resolution for duplicate events
- Progress callbacks for UI updates
- Integration with existing auth and database layers
- Rollback capabilities for failed batch operations

## Data Flow Architecture

```
[Data Collectors] -> [QueueManager] -> [OfflineStorage]
                           |
[NetworkDetector] -> [SyncEngine] -> [Supabase Backend]
                           |
                    [Conflict Resolution]
```

## Performance Requirements

### Queue Processing
- Support 10,000+ queued items
- Process 100 items per batch
- Target <100ms per item processing
- Memory usage <50MB for queue operations

### Storage Optimization
- Compress payloads >1KB (target 60% reduction)
- Encrypt sensitive fields (numbers, content)
- Maintain <10MB total storage footprint
- Age-based cleanup (30 days retention)

### Network Efficiency
- Wi-Fi preferred for large syncs
- Cellular fallback after thresholds:
  - 24 hours offline
  - 1MB queue size
  - User-initiated sync
- Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s (max 5 retries)

## Integration Points

### Existing Components
- **AuthProvider**: Use existing auth context for user session
- **Supabase Client**: Integrate with existing database connection
- **Types Package**: Extend existing Event and Contact types
- **Constants**: Use shared performance targets and limits

### Mobile Platform Integration
- **Background Tasks**: Use Expo TaskManager for background sync
- **App State**: React to foreground/background transitions
- **Permissions**: Integrate with existing permission system
- **Notifications**: Progress updates and sync status

## Error Handling Strategy

### Queue Failures
- Exponential backoff with jitter
- Dead letter queue for permanent failures
- Detailed error logging with context
- User notification for critical failures

### Network Failures
- Graceful degradation during offline periods
- Queue persistence across app restarts
- Automatic retry on network restoration
- User feedback for long offline periods

### Storage Failures
- Backup to secondary storage location
- Recovery from corrupted queue state
- Storage quota monitoring and cleanup
- Fallback to memory-only mode if needed

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- QueueItem serialization/deserialization
- OfflineStorage CRUD operations
- NetworkDetector state transitions
- QueueManager priority processing
