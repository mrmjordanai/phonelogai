# Events Screen Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a production-ready Events Screen for the PhoneLog AI mobile app with comprehensive data viewing, filtering, and interaction capabilities.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Hooks and Data Layer
- **useEvents**: Main data fetching hook with pagination and caching
- **useEventFilters**: Filter state management with persistence
- **useInfiniteScroll**: Performance-optimized infinite scrolling

### Phase 2: Component Implementation
- **EventListItem**: Individual event display with privacy-aware rendering
- **EventsList**: Virtualized list component with pull-to-refresh
- **EventFilters**: Comprehensive filtering UI (type, date, contact, etc.)
- **EventDetailModal**: Detailed event view with actions
- **EmptyState**: User-friendly empty states with actionable guidance

### Phase 3: Main Screen Integration
- **EventsScreen.tsx**: Complete screen with navigation, search, and state management
- Integration with existing services and navigation
- Error boundaries and loading states

### Phase 4: Integration and Polish
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Accessibility improvements (screen reader support, focus management)
- Error handling with retry mechanisms
- Final testing and refinements

## Technical Requirements

### Data Layer
- Use existing EventService for data operations
- Implement efficient pagination with cursor-based approach
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Handle offline scenarios gracefully

### UI/UX Requirements
- Clean, professional design consistent with app theme
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Infinite scroll with loading indicators
- Search functionality with debouncing

### Performance Targets
- List rendering: <16ms per item for 60fps
- Initial load: <2s for first screen of data
- Memory usage: <50MB for 1000+ events
- Smooth scrolling on mid-range devices

### Privacy Integration
- Respect privacy rules for contact display
- Anonymize sensitive data when required
- Show privacy indicators where appropriate

## Key Features

### Event Display
- Timeline view with smart grouping
- Type-specific icons and styling
- Duration and timestamp formatting
- Contact integration with privacy handling

### Filtering System
- Event type (call, SMS, missed call, etc.)
- Date range picker
- Contact selection
- Duration ranges
- Advanced search

### Interaction Features
- Tap to view details
- Long press for quick actions
- Swipe gestures for common operations
- Share/export capabilities

### Accessibility
- VoiceOver/TalkBack support
- Semantic labeling
- Focus management
- High contrast support
