# Privacy Controls Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of comprehensive per-contact privacy controls for the Call/SMS Intelligence Platform. The system will provide granular visibility and anonymization settings for each contact, supporting the three-tier privacy model (private/team/public) with compliance features.

## Architecture Analysis

### Current State
- Database schema already includes `privacy_rules` table with visibility and anonymization controls
- Database functions already implement privacy filtering in `get_filtered_events()` and `get_contact_intelligence()`
- Existing RBAC system with 5-tier roles: owner > admin > analyst > member > viewer
- Phone number anonymization utility function already exists
- Audit logging infrastructure in place

### Privacy Model
- **Private**: Only the data owner can see the contact's information
- **Team**: Team members can see based on RBAC permissions (default)
- **Public**: All organization members can see the contact
- **Anonymization**: Separate controls for phone numbers and content
- **Default Behavior**: Team-visible with bulk anonymize option during onboarding
