# Sync Health UI Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implementation plan for the user interface and notification components for the sync health monitoring system. This builds on the completed core monitoring services (SyncHealthMonitor, SyncMetrics, HealthChecker) to provide comprehensive mobile user experience.

## Plan Details

### 1. SyncHealthDisplay.tsx Component
**Location**: `/apps/mobile/src/components/SyncHealthDisplay.tsx`

**Purpose**: React Native component for sync health visualization with real-time status display.

**Key Features**:
- Real-time sync status display with color-coded health indicators
- Last sync timestamps with relative time formatting (using react-native built-ins)
- Queue depth indicators with trend analysis
- Data drift percentage display with historical context
- Sync health history and trend visualizations
- Pull-to-refresh functionality for manual sync triggers
- Integration with existing SyncHealthMonitor service

**Implementation Approach**:
1. Create component following existing mobile component patterns (similar to DashboardScreen.tsx)
2. Use React hooks for state management and real-time updates
3. Implement health score visualization with color-coded indicators
4. Add interactive elements for manual sync triggering
5. Include proper error boundaries and loading states
6. Follow existing styling patterns from DashboardScreen.tsx

**Dependencies**:
- Existing SyncHealthMonitor service
- Existing SyncMetrics service
- React Native components and Expo icons
- Async Storage for persistence
- Pull-to-refresh functionality

### 2. SyncNotifications.tsx Component  
**Location**: `/apps/mobile/src/components/SyncNotifications.tsx`

**Purpose**: Notification management system for critical sync issues and status changes.

**Key Features**:
- Push notification system for critical sync issues (using Expo Notifications)
- In-app notification banners for status changes
- Data drift warnings with actionable guidance
- Manual sync reminders based on usage patterns
- Recovery completion notifications
- Notification priority management and throttling
- User preferences for notification types and frequency

**Implementation Approach**:
1. Create notification management service
2. Integrate with Expo Notifications for push notifications
3. Implement in-app banner system for immediate feedback
4. Add user preference system for notification control
5. Include notification throttling to prevent spam
6. Handle offline scenarios gracefully

**Dependencies**:
- Expo Notifications (will need to be added to package.json)
- Existing SyncHealthMonitor service for event listening
- AsyncStorage for user preferences
- Integration with device notification permissions

### 3. Integration and Testing Strategy

**Component Integration**:
- Both components will integrate with existing services via EventEmitter patterns
- Use existing mobile component patterns for consistency
- Follow established styling and UX conventions
- Ensure proper error handling and fallback states

**Performance Optimization**:
- Implement efficient re-rendering patterns
- Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive operations
- Batch notification updates to prevent performance issues
- Optimize for battery usage and background processing

**Accessibility**:
- Add proper accessibility labels and hints
- Ensure color-blind friendly health indicators
- Include screen reader support for all interactive elements
- Follow React Native accessibility best practices

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies to Add:
```json
"expo-notifications": "~0.20.0"
```

### File Structure:
```
apps/mobile/src/components/
├── SyncHealthDisplay.tsx       # Main sync health UI component
└── SyncNotifications.tsx       # Notification management component
```

### Integration Points:
- SyncHealthMonitor service (existing)
- SyncMetrics service (existing)  
- HealthChecker service (existing)
- Mobile app navigation system
- User preference system
- Device notification permissions

## Success Criteria

### SyncHealthDisplay Component:
- [ ] Real-time health status visualization with 4-tier color coding
- [ ] Queue depth and drift percentage displays with trend indicators
- [ ] Last sync timestamp with relative formatting
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh for manual sync triggering
- [ ] Responsive design optimized for mobile devices
- [ ] Proper loading and error states
- [ ] Integration with SyncHealthMonitor events

### SyncNotifications Component:
- [ ] Push notification system for critical issues
- [ ] In-app banner notifications for status changes
- [ ] User preference system for notification control
- [ ] Notification throttling and priority management
- [ ] Offline scenario handling
- [ ] Integration with device notification permissions
- [ ] Clear actionable guidance for sync issues

### Overall Integration:
- [ ] Consistent with existing mobile app patterns
- [ ] Proper error boundaries and fallback states
- [ ] Optimized for performance and battery usage
- [ ] Accessibility features implemented
- [ ] Manual testing on both iOS and Android

## Implementation Notes

### Color Coding System:
- **Green (#10B981)**: Healthy (90-100% health score)
- **Yellow (#F59E0B)**: Warning (70-89% health score)  
- **Orange (#F97316)**: Error (40-69% health score)
- **Red (#EF4444)**: Critical (<40% health score)

### Notification Priorities:
- **High**: Critical sync failures, data loss risks
- **Medium**: Performance degradation, sync lag warnings
- **Low**: Routine status updates, optimization suggestions

### Performance Targets:
- Component render time <100ms
- Notification response time <500ms
- Memory usage <10MB additional overhead
- Battery impact <1% per day for background monitoring

This implementation will provide a comprehensive sync health experience for mobile users, with clear visual indicators, timely notifications, and proper integration with the existing monitoring services.
