# Time Explorer Dashboard Implementation Plan

## Overview
Creating a comprehensive Time Explorer dashboard component for the Call/SMS Intelligence Platform that provides interactive timeline visualization, filtering, and data exploration capabilities.

## Architecture & Design Decisions

### Component Structure
```
apps/web/src/components/dashboard/
├── TimeExplorer.tsx              # Main container component
├── TimeExplorerChart.tsx         # Interactive chart visualization
├── DateRangePicker.tsx           # Date range selection
└── TimeExplorerFilters.tsx       # Event type/direction filters
```

### Technology Stack
- **Charting Library**: Recharts (lightweight, React-native, performant)
- **Date Handling**: Built-in Date APIs + custom utilities (avoid heavy date libraries)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with responsive design patterns
- **State Management**: React hooks + React Query for data fetching
- **Performance**: Virtual scrolling, data aggregation, efficient re-renders

### Data Flow & Performance Strategy
1. **Aggregated Data Approach**: Instead of loading raw events, aggregate data by time buckets (hourly/daily/weekly)
2. **Progressive Loading**: Load summary data first, then drill-down details on demand
3. **Caching Strategy**: Use React Query with stale-while-revalidate for optimal UX
4. **Efficient Queries**: Leverage database functions for server-side aggregation

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Core Components and Data Layer

#### Task 1.1: Add Required Dependencies
- Add Recharts for charting
- Add date-fns for date utilities (lightweight alternative)
- Add React Query for data fetching

#### Task 1.2: Create Date Range Picker Component
- Custom component with preset ranges (Today, Last 7 days, Last 30 days, etc.)
- Calendar popup for custom date selection
- Timezone handling and validation
- Accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)

#### Task 1.3: Create Filter Controls Component
- Event type toggles (calls, SMS, both)
- Direction filters (inbound, outbound, both)
- Contact search/autocomplete
- Clear all filters functionality
- State management for filter persistence

#### Task 1.4: Database Query Functions
- Create aggregation functions for time-series data
- Implement efficient queries that respect RLS policies
- Add caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Performance optimization for large datasets

### Phase 2: Chart Visualization

#### Task 2.1: Time Explorer Chart Component
- Interactive timeline using Recharts
- Support for different time granularities (hour, day, week, month)
- Zoom and pan capabilities
- Hover tooltips with event details
- Responsive design for mobile/tablet

#### Task 2.2: Chart Interactivity
- Click-to-drill-down functionality
- Brush selection for time range filtering
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Loading states and error handling

### Phase 3: Main Time Explorer Component

#### Task 3.1: Container Component
- Combine all sub-components
- State management for filters and date ranges
- Real-time data updates via Supabase subscriptions
- Error boundaries and loading states

#### Task 3.2: Export Functionality
- Export chart as PNG/SVG
- Export filtered data as CSV
- Share functionality (generate shareable links)
- Print-friendly layouts

### Phase 4: Performance & Accessibility

#### Task 4.1: Performance Optimization
- Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Debounced search and filtering
- Memoization of expensive calculations
- Lazy loading of components

#### Task 4.2: Accessibility Implementation
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode support
- Focus management

#### Task 4.3: Internationalization
- Add i18n keys for all text content
- Number and date formatting per locale
- RTL layout considerations
- Dynamic locale switching

## Technical Specifications

### Database Integration
```typescript
// Use existing database functions and create new ones as needed
const timeSeriesQuery = `
  SELECT 
    date_trunc('hour', ts) as time_bucket,
    type,
    direction,
    COUNT(*) as event_count,
    AVG(CASE WHEN duration IS NOT NULL THEN duration ELSE NULL END) as avg_duration
  FROM events 
  WHERE user_id = $1 
    AND ts BETWEEN $2 AND $3
  GROUP BY time_bucket, type, direction
  ORDER BY time_bucket
`;
```

### Performance Requirements
- Load time: < 1.5s (p95) for dashboard load
- Interactive response: < 200ms for filter changes
- Memory usage: < 50MB for 1M events (aggregated view)
- Chart rendering: < 500ms for 10k data points

### Component API Design
```typescript
interface TimeExplorerProps {
  userId: string;
  initialDateRange?: DateRange;
  initialFilters?: EventFilters;
  onDateRangeChange?: (range: DateRange) => void;
  onFiltersChange?: (filters: EventFilters) => void;
  className?: string;
}
```

## MVP Feature Set
1. Basic timeline chart with call/SMS data
2. Date range picker with presets
3. Event type filtering
4. Basic export to CSV
5. Responsive design
6. Loading and error states

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
1. Advanced drill-down capabilities
2. Comparison mode (multiple date ranges)
3. Anomaly detection highlighting
4. Custom time bucket selection
5. Advanced export options (PDF reports)
6. Real-time collaboration features

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for all components
2. Integration tests for data flow
3. Performance tests with large datasets
4. Accessibility testing with screen readers
5. Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Success Metrics
- Component load time < 1.5s (p95)
- User interaction response < 200ms
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance score
- Zero accessibility violations
- Mobile usability score > 95

This plan prioritizes performance, accessibility, and user experience while maintaining architectural consistency with the existing codebase. The MVP approach ensures we can deliver core functionality quickly while building a foundation for future enhancements.
