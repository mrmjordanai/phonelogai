**Changes Required**:
- Initialize SyncHealthMonitor on app startup
- Handle app lifecycle events (background/foreground)
- Set up error boundaries for health monitoring
- Coordinate with existing AuthProvider

**Initialization Flow**:
```typescript
// App startup sequence:
1. Initialize AuthProvider
2. Initialize SyncHealthMonitor
3. Start monitoring (if user authenticated)
4. Set up lifecycle event handlers
5. Initialize other services
```

#### Task 3.2: Background/Foreground Handling
**Purpose**: Proper state management during app transitions

**Changes Required**:
- Adjust monitoring frequency in background

## Technical Implementation Details

### Event Flow Architecture
```
DataCollectionService -> SyncHealthMonitor
OfflineQueue -> SyncHealthMonitor  
SyncService -> SyncHealthMonitor
ConflictResolver -> SyncHealthMonitor
SyncHealthMonitor -> UI Components (via events)
SyncHealthMonitor -> Notifications
```

### Error Handling Strategy
- Graceful degradation if health monitoring fails
- Fallback to basic sync without health features
- Error boundaries prevent health issues from crashing app
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures

### Performance Considerations
- Minimize health monitoring overhead
- Batch health updates to reduce storage writes
- Use efficient event listeners and cleanup
- Optimize for battery usage in background

### Privacy and Security
- Health data stored locally only
- No sensitive data in health metrics
- Respect user privacy preferences
- Secure local storage of health configuration
