## Technical Implementation Details

### Real-time Update Strategy
```typescript
// Event listener pattern
useEffect(() => {
  const healthMonitor = SyncHealthMonitor.getInstance();
  
  const handleStatusChange = (status: SyncHealthStatus) => {
    setSyncHealthStatus(status);
    // Trigger relevant UI updates
  };
  
  healthMonitor.on('status_changed', handleStatusChange);
  return () => healthMonitor.off('status_changed', handleStatusChange);
}, []);
```

### Navigation Integration
```typescript
// Enhanced quick actions with navigation
const navigation = useNavigation();

const quickActions = [
  {
    title: 'Chat with Data',
    icon: 'chatbubbles',
    onPress: () => navigation.navigate('Chat'),
    badge: pendingQueries
  },
  {
    title: 'Manual Sync',
    icon: 'refresh',
    onPress: () => triggerManualSync(),
    loading: isSyncing
  }
];
```

### Performance Monitoring
```typescript
// Performance metrics collection
interface PerformanceMetrics {
  memoryUsage: number;
  renderTime: number;
  networkLatency: number;
  syncLatency: number;
  batteryOptimized: boolean;
}
```
